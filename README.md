# Self-Study CS

[This README is current as of August 2020]

This is a catch-all repository for various self-study assignments I've worked on. Most of them use an existing set of lecture notes or textbook as their basis. I intend to keep adding to this, and will try and keep the table of contents updated.

## Table of Contents

-**Algorithms**: Implementations and variations of common algorithms, as well as some specific assignments based on a Cambridge course.
-**CProg**: C/C++ assignments based on a Cambridge course.
-**HFDP**: Exercises from 'Head First Design Patterns' by Sierra, Bates, Freeman, and Robson (Most of the 'exercises' are just copying and testing code provided by the book, so this mostly a reference for design patterns).
-**OCaml:Functional**: A single exercise from a Cambridge course on functional programming (I decided to create this repo just as I was finishing up this course, so a lot of work was not preserved).
-**OOP**: Exercises from Cambridge's Object-Oriented Programming course. Includes a series of exercises elaborating on the class Game of Life simulation.
-**SciComp**: A few exercises from a Cambridge course on scientific computing with Python. The links for the data sets in later exercises were dead so I was unable to continue.
